Documentation
-----------------------------------------------

This module allows you to add product variations
(e.g. colour, size, sex) to ecommerce products.
It also provides a method in doing so efficiently,
by allowing you to specifiy default combinations
in parent pages.
The way this works is that you specify what
option groups should be available in child product pages
(e.g. colour and size) and when you save the product,
it will automatically create all the combinations (e.g.
red S, red M, red L, blue S, blue M, etc...) for the
product.

To do
-----------------------------------------------
LOTS!
create a checkbox that allows you to choose
IF combinations should be created when saving
a product.


Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------
1. Find out how to add modules to SS and add module as per usual.
2. copy configurations from this module's _config.php file
into mysite/_config.php file and edit settings as required.
NB. the idea is not to edit the module, but instead customise it
in your mysite folder at all so that you can upgrade it later.

If you just want one or two things from this module
then of course you are free to copy them to your
mysite folder and delete the rest of this module.
