code base.

DECORATORS:

AjaxOrder: this is one of the core files of this module that
allows you to add ajax functionality for adding and deleting
from cart. It also has function for deleting all cookie-nised
content, which can be useful for testing purposes.
TO DO:
* move the testing stuff to its own decorator.
* provide more html snippets for ajax stuff







Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------
1. Find out how to add modules to SS and add module as per usual.
2. copy configurations from this module's _config.php file
into mysite/_config.php file and edit settings as required.
NB. the idea is not to edit the module, but instead customise it
in your mysite folder at all so that you can upgrade it later.

If you just want one or two things from this module
then of course you are free to copy them to your
mysite folder and delete the rest of this module.
