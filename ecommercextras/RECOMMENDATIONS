RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CURRENT ECOMMERCE:

1. replace templates folder
2. replace javascript
3. remove the ability to delete status notes (which is not working anyway).
4. allow the order status options to be customised
5. the order status "query" is unclear.  has the person paid
6. the order status "paid" should be determined by whether a payment is record, NOT just an order status, this will also remove the need for Order::$paid_status
7. separate the order status from the payment status, as this is confusing (e.g. an order can be sent without having be paid, an order can be paid, but not available, etc...)
