Developer
-----------------------------------------------
Nicolaas [at] sunnysideup.co.nz

Requirements
-----------------------------------------------
SilverStripe 2.3.0 or greater.

Documentation
-----------------------------------------------
Is the payment class for selling things using
DPS via their site payment geteway rather than
on your own website (which requires you to have
a security certificate and be PCI compliant).

Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------
1. Find out how to add modules to SS and add module as per usual.
2. copy configurations from this module's _config.php file
into mysite/_config.php file and edit settings as required.
NB. the idea is not to edit the module, but instead customise it
in your mysite folder at all so that you can upgrade it later.

If you just want one or two things from this module
then of course you are free to copy them to your
mysite folder and delete the rest of this module.
