This module adds products to your ecommerce that
have variations.  You can have up to five variations, e.g.

1. colour
2. size
3. sex
4. version
5. model

*** List Combo System ***
The way it works is that you maintain up to five lists.
These lists are then combined into all possible variations
and these are added to all products.
This saves you from having to enter them for each product.
However, you will have to enter a price for the variation,
in order to activate it.

*** front-end dropdowns ***
The code also provides for up to five dropdowns that you
can place in your templates.  Together, these dropdowns
determine the final choice (using JS) of product.
Product Variations can only be added to cart once all aspects of the
variation have been determined.
Any change in dropdown will update the other dropdowns with available
choices. In this way, you will never end up with an impossible choice.
You can also opt get all the variations in one dropdown.





Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------
1. Find out how to add modules to SS and add module as per usual.
2. copy configurations from this module's _config.php file
into mysite/_config.php file and edit settings as required.
NB. the idea is not to edit the module, but instead customise it
in your mysite folder at all so that you can upgrade it later.
