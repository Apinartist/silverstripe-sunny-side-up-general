Requirements
-----------------------------------------------
SilverStripe 2.3.0 or greater.

Documentation
-----------------------------------------------
A basic slideshow module that can work out of the box,
but also has a lot of customisation options.
It allows you to add a folder / a bunch of images to any
page in your CMS and, if you have included the
SlideShow template, it will show a small slideshow
(first image shows, fades out, second image fades in, and so on).
If anything, it can be a useful "base" module to
extend into something more fancy.


Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------
1. Find out how to add modules to SS and add module as per usual.

2. copy configurations from this module's _config.php file
into mysite/_config.php file and edit settings as required.
NB. the idea is not to edit the module at all, but instead customise
it from your mysite folder, so that you can upgrade the module without redoing the settings.

3. add <% include SlideShowSection %> to your template

CUSTOMISATION:

there are two things you can do to customise

1. you can theme the templates
2. you can opt for an alternative JS files (see _config for more information)
